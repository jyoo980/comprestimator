# comprestimator

This repository contains the Windows and Linux executables for the 
[IBM FlashSystem Comprestimator](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-flashsystem-comprestimator),
a tool for estimating the compression savings for a file system, volume, or other data set.

This is only available to be built on the Windows operating system. This is often a challenge
for reproduciblity efforts when not all researchers are guaranteed to have access to Windows.

In short, I've built the executables myself on a Windows 10 Partition on macOS, and uploaded them here.
The licenses that came with the comprestimator appear to have no restrictions on distributing this software,
but I've also included them here.
